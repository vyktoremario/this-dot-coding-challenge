## Tech stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Time limit

You have 25 minutes to complete the challenge as a team.

## The challenge

- Build out the design for the e-commerce product page
- create a light box galley with 5 images
- users should be able to open the light box gallery by clicking on the large product image
- users should be able to switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images

**NOTE: You do not need to build out any of the cart functionality due to time contraints**

## The goal

The goal is to practice your teamwork and communication skills. The team that comes the closest to completing the design and building out the light box wins.

## Where to find everything

All of the designs are located inside the `/design` folder.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
